## How does this differ from pi hole?
Pihole is a great ad blocker, I just thought there were too many lines of code. What I aim to simplify is using basic software components and run a similar setup. In the end it really is just dnsmasq with a few config files. I am also going to be setting up defaults that I believe are good enough to not need other options. 

## How it works
1. Start up dnsmasq
2. Setup dnsmaq.conf
3. Download hosts files
4. Set up cron job
